# Changelog

Each `## <version>` section becomes the GitHub release notes for that tag (tool/changelog.sh) and is
shown in the app under Settings → App version. Write for people using the app, not for developers.

## 0.2.0

- **SSH terminal** in tabs: open a host and get a shell. Tabs work like Chrome's: swipe the header to switch, swipe down (or tap the counter) for all tabs, swipe a card away to close it, with Undo. Your tabs come back after a restart.
- **Hosts**: save servers with keys, an optional saved password, a jump host, a group and a colour. Or type `user@host` into Quick connect.
- **SSH keys**: generate Ed25519, ECDSA or RSA keys, or import OpenSSH, PEM, PKCS#8 and PuTTY keys. Share the public key as text or a QR code, install it on a server in one tap, protect keys with a passphrase or the device lock.
- **Server keys are checked**: nux asks before trusting a new server and warns loudly if a server's key changes.
- Extra keys above the keyboard: Esc, Tab, Ctrl, Alt, arrows and the symbols phone keyboards hide.

## 0.1.0

- First build: settings (theme, language), in-app updates from GitHub releases with an optional beta channel, and this changelog.
- SSH, SFTP, port forwarding and the editor come next.
